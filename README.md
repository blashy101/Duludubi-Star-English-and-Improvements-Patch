# Duludubi-Star-English-and-Improvements-Patch

Hello,

Copy the contents of the zip into your directory with the game's executable, run patcher.bat, and you should be good to go.

Improvements:

Locale Emulator no longer required, just run the executable and you're good to go

Game's launcher menu thing is mostly in English but just tells you what to do cause the other features don't exist anymore.

Game now supports XInput controllers, buttons are mapped as follows:

GamePad A Button -> Right Click

GamePad B Button -> Space Bar

GamePad X Button -> + Key (for Camera Adjustment)

GamePad Y Button -> - Key (for Camera Adjustment)

GamePad LB Button -> Q Key

GamePad RB Button -> E Key

GamePad RT Button -> Left Click

Left Stick and DPad tied to WSAD for movement

Right Stick moves mouse cursor for menuing

Other buttons unused/unmapped

The mouse will still function with a controller connected if you wish to menu with the mouse instead, keyboard is disabled
XInput features will not be active when a controller is not connected so you can use mouse/keyboard no problem if you want.

There will be bugs probably, the translation is definitely not accurate because its machine translated because I don't speak Chinese lol.

Have fun!
